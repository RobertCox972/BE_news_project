# NC News

**Api Built with Express & PSQL**

A hosted version of this project is available here: https://r-cox-be-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api

This is the backend project source for NC-News, an API project set by NorthCoders.

Installs needed for this project are Node, Express and PG-format.

As the .env files for database connection are .gitignored, you will need to create your own '.env.test' and '.env.development' files in the main directory of the project.

.. More to come.
